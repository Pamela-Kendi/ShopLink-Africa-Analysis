# ShopLink-Africa-Analysis
## Project Overview
This is an end-to-end simulated project done on Microsoft Excel of an ecommerce Startup operating in West-Africa. It specializes in the sale of electronics, fashion, and home goods. Starting with raw data, I performed extensive data cleaning, transformation, and exploration, before building a dashboard that allows users to monitor performance and uncover insights at a glance. The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world business analytics scenario where quick, accurate, and dynamic reporting is needed to guide decision-making. By leveraging advanced Excel features such as Pivot Tables, formulas, and pivot charts, I transformed raw data into a decision-support tool that can be used by top management.

## Insights and Recommendations
1. Baby Monitor brings in the highest amount of sales, however, in-depth product and market analysis need to be perfomed to determine which other products can be added to the portfolio in order to diversify it and bring in more sales.
2. Kara, Tsevie, and Atakpame markets bring in the highest income while Tamale, Accra, and Takoradi bring in the lowest amount in sales potentially due to delivery delays.
3. QuickBee, LocalLink, and EcoCourier are our best performing courier services with an average delivery time of 2 days while ExpressJet and GoDeliver have the poorest delivery time with an average delivery time of nearly 5 days. Technology, and route-optimization should be used to improve delivery experience.
4. Strategies like rigorous advertising, upselling, cross-selling, product-bundling, and post-sale engagements should be utilised in order to improve the average order value.

# ShopLink-Africa-Analysis
## Project Overview
This is an end-to-end simulated project done on Microsoft Excel of an ecommerce Startup operating in West-Africa. It specializes in the sale of electronics, fashion, and home goods. Starting with raw data, I performed extensive data cleaning, transformation, and exploration, before building a dashboard that allows users to monitor performance and uncover insights at a glance. The goal of this project was to simulate a real-world business analytics scenario where quick, accurate, and dynamic reporting is needed to guide decision-making. By leveraging advanced Excel features such as Pivot Tables,formulas, and pivot charts, I transformed raw data into a decision-support tool that can be used by top management.
